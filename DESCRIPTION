Title: simpler single cell RNAseq data clustering
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Xianwen Ren, Liangtao Zheng
Maintainer: Liangtao Zheng <tao2013@gmail.com>
Description: A package implement mutilple functionalities which are commonly used in single cell RNAseq data analysis, 
    including variable genes identification, dimension reduction, clustering on reduced data. Also some new ideas were proposed, such as 
    projecting data to a feature space using spearman correlation which make visualiaztion and clustering more efficient, clustering with 
    subsampling and classfification which make it feasible to process thousands cells' data.
